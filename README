# Predicting the Most Common POI Type in a Region using GIS and ML

This project uses OpenStreetMap data and spatial features (POI density, land use, place type) to predict the most common point-of-interest (POI) type per 500m grid cell across the West Midlands region.

## Steps:
- Generate uniform grid over West Midlands
- Aggregate POIs and label cells
- Engineer spatial features (POI diversity, landuse, etc.)
- Train and evaluate Random Forest and XGBoost models

## Tech Stack:
- Python (GeoPandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib)
- OpenStreetMap + GeoFabrik West Midlands extract
